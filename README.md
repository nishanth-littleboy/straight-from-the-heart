# Straight-From-The-Heart
A beautiful, interactive web-based gift featuring synced lyrics, a starry background, and a special surprise at the end.

##✨Features:

 - Synced Lyrics: Lyrics are perfectly timed to the background music using the HTML5 Audio API's currentTime property to ensure they never drift.

 - Aesthetic Background: A deep space theme with a radial gradient and dynamically generated twinkling stars inspired by React/Framer Motion designs.

 - Responsive Animations: Smooth "Blur-In-Up" text animations for a high-quality cinematic feel.

 - Video Surprise: A cute animated penguin reveal that triggers exactly on the final line of the song.

##🛠️ Built With:

 - HTML5 - Structure and semantic layout.
 - CSS3 - Custom animations, radial gradients, and neon glow effects.
 - JavaScript (Vanilla) - Star generation logic and precise audio synchronization.

##🎵 Music & Media:

 - Song: "I think they call this love" (bg.mp3).
 - Visuals: Animated penguin video (cat.mp4).

 ##🚀Execution Guide:

 Ensure you have all the necessary files in a single folder:

 - index.html (The structure)
 - style.css (The purple/starry theme)
 - script.js (The lyric-sync logic)
 - music.mp3 (The background track)
 - cat.mp4 (The final surprise video)

 - Open the terminal (Ctrl + `).
 - Type python -m http.server 8000 and press Enter.
 - Open your browser and visit: http://localhost:8000.
